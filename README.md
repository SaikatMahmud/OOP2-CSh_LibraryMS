Though the project will execute properly, codes/forms may show some errors (after loading) when opening for 1st time. Which can be solved by restarting the Visual Studio & reopening the project.
In my case this problem occurs several times for unknown reason & the issue is solved without any hassle after reopening.

Project created using 'Visual Studio 2019' and 'SSMS 2018'
